### _Please note that the rubric has changed as of 7/16/2015_

This project involves students purely taking notes on [Stage 5](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud000/l-4149648704/m-3532629495)

They will take lessons that involve:

* Javascript, jQuery, AJAX
* Using APIs
* Recursion
* Solving Big Problems
* Responsive Web Design

Furthermore, Stage 5 gives students the option to look at lessons from the 

* [Swift class for iOS](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-ios-app-development-with-swift--ud585)
* [Android for Beginner's](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-development-for-beginners--ud837)
* [Intro to Relational Databases](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud197)
* [Design of Computer Programs](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs212)


The student is required to ONLY write notes about any of the topics mentioned above. They do not necessary have to demonstrate their knowledge with computer code, but they certainly can demonstrate their knowledge with their code to get "Exceeds Specifications" on the project.

The reviewer should be comfortable with at least one of the listed topics mentioned above in order to grade a student's understanding of the material presented in Stage 5. If the reviewer picks up a project where a student writes about a topic that the reviewer is not familiar with, then the reviewer should return the project back to the queue.

## Reviewer Instructions for Stage 5

### 1. View student’s web page

The file you receive from students, when unzipped, should contain a file called `app.yaml`

The top of the file should look something like this:

```yaml
application: learn-2-code
version: 1
runtime: python27
api_version: 1
threadsafe: true
```

The value of `application:` is the student’s **appspot ID** (in this case `learn-2-code`)

The **appspot ID** determines the URL for the web page the student should have built. In this case, the URL would be [http://learn-2-code.appspot.com](http://learn-2-code.appspot.com)

You should go to the corresponding URL to see the student’s page.

### 2. Review submission

The student’s web page should have a section that either explains or demonstrates what they’ve learned in the last course of the Nanodegree (where they are encouraged to pursue something that interests them on their own).

I suspect most submissions will meet specifications. This stage is intentionally easy.

Below is the Stage 5 project rubric (updated 7/16/2015):

### 3. If student passes, generate a “secret key”

If the student has passed, that means they have completed the Nanodegree! This is a big deal. By successfully completing, they’ve also earned the right to add their project to a list of student submissions. But doing this requires that they have a “secret key.”

You should generate a 6-character secret key by calling the `generate_secret_key` function with the student’s **appspot ID**.

You can copy and paste the `generate_secret_key` function into your favorite Python editor.

```python
def generate_secret_key(appspot_id):
    import hashlib

    def is_valid_appspot_id(appspot_id):
        """Helper function to help identify invalid IDs"""
        num_chars = len(appspot_id)
        if num_chars < 6 or num_chars > 30:
            print "appspot ids are between 6 and 30 characters"
            return False
        valid_chars = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789-"
        for char in appspot_id:
            if char not in valid_chars:
                print "appspot ids do not allow: %s" % char
                return False
        return True

    # Check for valid appspot_id
    if not is_valid_appspot_id(appspot_id):
        print "Invalid appspot ID"
        return None

    # appspot_id looks good. Generate key...
    hashed_id = hashlib.sha224(appspot_id).hexdigest()
    secret_key = hashed_id[0:6] # simplicity > security

    print "Secret key is: %s" % secret_key
    return secret_key
```

### 4. Write Feedback
If the project does not meet expectations in any of the rubric categories please be very specific about what the student needs to do to pass their next next submission. Also please read through their notes and if the student shows confusion or is inaccurate, please guide the student to the correct information, either through linking or explaining.

If the project meets expectations, congratulate the student! They've come a long way.


And don't forget to include the `secret_key` and the submission URL [http://learn-2-code.appspot.com/student_submissions/](http://learn-2-code.appspot.com/student_submissions/) in the review. The first part of your review might look something like this:

```
Congratulations on completing the Nanodegree! You've earned the right to add your project to the list of completed student projects here: http://learn-2-code.appspot.com/student_submissions/

You will need to use the following "secret key" to add your project: abc123
```
