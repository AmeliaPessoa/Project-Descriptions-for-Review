# Reverse Mad-Libs Game Reviewer Guideline

# Reviewer Instructions

Students will write Python code to create a [Mad Libs game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs), or a fill-in-the blank game. Throughout Stage 2, students learn how to build a Mad Libs style game with the instructor where a user is asked for nouns, adjectives, and verbs in order to complete a story.

This time, the player is asked to fill-in-the blank based on the context of the story and not on a simple prompt for nouns, adjectives, and verbs.

Students will extend their basic game they built in Stage 2 by adding:

* at least 3 game levels
* at least 3 difficulty levels
* at least 4 blanks to fill in per level
* their own content

Below is an example of how the game can look like:

The students have a basic knowledge of:

* Decision statements
* While and For loops
* Functions
* Lists
* Variables
* Print statements
* Raw input

These are very beginner level students and the reviewer should not give recommendations with advanced code that the students would not understand.

# Project Specification


### 1 - Game Review
The reviewer will run the game and provide feedback on:

* **Game Basics**: Game has 3 or more levels. Each level contains 4 more blanks to fill in.

* **Beginning the Game**: Immediately after running the program, user is prompted to select a difficulty level from easy / medium / hard. 

  Once a level is selected, game displays a fill-in-the-blank and a prompt to fill in the first blank.

* **Game Play**: When player guesses correctly, new prompt shows with correct answer in the previous blank and a new prompt for the next blank

   When player guesses incorrectly, they are prompted to try again.

### 2 - Code Review
In addition to looking at the gameplay, students write, their project reviewer will also read their code to ensure they are appropriately applying the key programming concepts they've covered in Stage 2:

* **Use of Variables**: Code uses appropriate variables. Variable names are self-defining.

* **Use of Functions**: Functions should be used to automate repetitive tasks produce appropriate output given their name.

* **Appropriate use of Data**: Appropriate data types are used consistently such as strings for text and lists for ordered data.

* **Appropriate use of other Coding Techniques**: Decisiion statements and loops are appropriately used such as **for element in list** to iterate through a data structure.

* **Comments/Documentation**: Each function includes a comment which explains the behavior, inputs, and outputs (when applicable).

The rubric that will be used is included below:
