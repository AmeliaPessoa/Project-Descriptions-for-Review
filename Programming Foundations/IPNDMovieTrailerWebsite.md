Introduction to Programming Movie Trailer Website Guideline
===========================================================

## Context

Students will write server-side code to store a list of their favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. Students will then serve this data as a web page allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the trailers. Please note that this project has slightly different requirements than the Full Stack version of this project. The full rubric is at the bottom of this page. 

The reviewer is expected to read studentsâ€™ code and add any clarification or commentary as necessary, this includes answering any questions the students have.

## How will students complete this project? 
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) 
2. Create a data structure (i.e. a Python Class) to store your favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer. 
3. Create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent your favorite movies; group all the instances together in a list. 
4. To help you generate a website that displays these movies, we have provided a Python module called <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud036/fresh_tomatoes.py" target="_blank">fresh_tomatoes.py</a> - this module has a function called **open_movies_page** that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes all of your favorite movies. 
5. Ensure your website renders correctly when you attempt to load it in a browser. 

##Project Display Example 
**Note: The screenshots on this page are just examples of one implementation of the minimal functionality. You are encouraged to redesign and strive for even better solutions.** The Movie Trailer Website project consists of server-side code to store a list of movies titles, along with its respective box art imagery and movie trailer website. The data should be served as a web page allowing visitors to review the movies and watch the trailers:
