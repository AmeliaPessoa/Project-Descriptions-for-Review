## Project Overview
Using Backbone, you will develop a single page app that tracks the user's calorie intake, and optionally, other health-related metrics. Typing food names into the search field will display a list of matching foods as provided by the health API. Users will be able to select an item from the list, and the item will be added to the list of foods the user is tracking. The total calorie count will also update to reflect the new daily total.

## Why this Project?
It's important that web developers have experience with multiple organizational libraries and frameworks. This experience is important to employers, and helps reiterate that there are many different tools for organizing applications.

## How does this help my Career?
* Employers are looking for developers who have experience with multiple libraries and frameworks, and who are willing and able to learn new ones.
* This project will further your experience building applications, specifically with Backbone
