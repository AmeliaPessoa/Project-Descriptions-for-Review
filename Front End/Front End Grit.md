#Project Instructions

Now that you’ve learned about the history of Front End Development, and where you stand in that evolving story, I want you to reflect on what your journey will be like as you develop your skills. You’ve heard from us about how our experience has been as web developers, but now you should read more from others about their problem solving strategies. Go ahead and read the following:

* [How To Navigate the Up and Downs Of Learning To Code](http://www.codeconquest.com/blog/how-to-navigate-the-up-and-downs-of-learning-to-code/)
* [My First Month Coding: An Emotional Roller Coaster](http://blog.thinkful.com/post/98829096308/my-first-month-coding-an-emotional-roller-coaster)
* Optional: [Why Learning to Code is So Damn Hard](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard)

Once you’ve read these, you’ll know all about the path ahead of you, and you’ll have even more tools to help you solve problems and grow your Developer Mindset.


###For this first project, I want you to do the following:

1. Imagine that you are a month into your Nanodegree program and you’re stuck. Totally stuck. You have no idea what’s wrong and you have no idea how to get yourself out of this mess. Create a .txt file and title it `lettertoself.txt`. In this file, write a letter to yourself. How will you solve your problem? What skills do you have now that will help you tackle challenges? How will what you’ve learned about having a growth mindset help you reach your goals?
2. Create another .txt file and title it `goals.txt`. Write a brief statement sharing your goals as a developer with us. These goals can be project goals, career goals, or personal goals. Is there a dream job you’re working toward? Is there a project idea you’ve been aching to start working on?
  * Optional: In addition to your goals, we also want to know about any questions you have about the process of becoming a Front End Developer. Is there anything about being a Front-End Developer that you’d like to know more about?

When you’re done, create a .zip from these files to submit to our project reviewers.

These files will be reviewed by our Udacity project reviewers, who are all working developers. They are real humans who have faced the same challenges you will, so they’ll be able to offer up some insights that may help you as you embark on these goals! Make sure to take some time to really think about these reflections. Many of these developers have had the same questions and concerns as you, and they want to hear what you have to say!
