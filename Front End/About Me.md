## Project Overview

You will get acquainted with your text editor, structure and syntax of HTML and CSS, have a chance to go through the code review process, and interact with your classmates in the Discussion Forums and team chat!

## What will I learn?

You will learn how to create and edit text files within your text editor, basic HTML to display a web page, and how to properly establish relative links between files.

## Why is this important to my career?

* As a Front-End Web Developer, your text editor is the most important tool in your toolbox.
* Using your text editor efficiently to create and edit files is the most basic and frequently accomplished task day to day.
* Properly understanding how directory/folder structures work and how to relatively link files are key to maintaining a well organized application.

## How do I Complete this Project?
### How to complete Part 1?
1. To start off, you need to download the site's source code, which you can find in the **Downloadables** section below. It's a zip file, so download it and unzip it somewhere you can easily find it on your computer.

2. Once you've unzipped the file, double click on 'index.html', which will open in your web browser. Opening index.html in your browser is just like navigating to the website online.  You'll see what it actually looks like. (You can also open 'index.html' by going to the File menu in your browser, clicking Open and navigating to 'index.html'.)

###How to Complete Part 2
1. To edit the website, you need to use a text editor. There are LOTS of different text editors. Most people try out a few and pick one that they really like to use all the time. If you're on a Mac, you can use the built-in TextEdit program. On Windows, there's Notepad. While those built-in editors are useful, they aren't made for code. We recommend using a program like <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a> to edit code because it's easy to use and gives you lots of helpful hints. This is a good time to go ahead and download it.

2. Start by opening index.html using a text editor. You can simply open up your text editor of choice and drag and drop the file into the editor. Or you can go to the file menu and choose open.

###Personalization Options
1. Find all of the placeholder texts and replace them with your own answers! Write a little about yourself, because you'll be sharing this site with your group mates later in the project.
2. Find a picture of you online and replace the placeholder image with it! You can do this by changing the URL in quotes in line 15. The image should be small and square, no bigger than 300x300px.
3. Save your index.html file then refresh your browser to see what those changes do to your site.
4. Try changing other pieces of text in the HTML. What happens? And don't worry if you break anything because you can always undo your way back to safety :)

###How to Complete Step 4
How do you add CSS to this website? Start with the forums, which are perfect for asking and answering hard questions about courses.
1. Check out the discussion forum post called <a href="https://discussions.udacity.com/t/project-0-about-me-css-steps/24951" target="_blank">Project 0: About Me CSS Steps</a> and copy the line of code that you find.
2. The forum post will tell you where the code goes in your site. Paste the code in and watch what happens when you refresh the page!

###How to Complete Step 5
1. Open styles.css in your text editor.
2. You should see a few blocks of code. Find the block that starts with `.my-picture` (line 81). This block of CSS styles your picture in the middle of the page.
3. See how there's a line that says `width: 100%;`? This style says that the picture should be displayed as large as possible inside its container on the page. Right now, its container is that dark blue bar, so the image is trying to take up as much space as it can inside.
4. Change `width` to `max-width`. `max-width` sets a boundary on how large an image can be without *actually* resizing the image. In other words, `max-width: 100%;` will prevent the image from overflowing the dark blue bar, but it won't force the image to expand its width past its natural width.
5. Refresh the page and see what happens!

###How to Complete Step 6
1. Now that you have the styles for the page, customize some colors! Go into styles.css and change the color of the colored bar in the middle of the screen. Do it by going into the `.hero` block and changing the `background-color`. You can use <a href="http://www.color-hex.com/" target="_blank">hex colors</a>, <a href="http://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.htm" target="_blank">rgb colors</a>, or <a href="http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/color.html" target="_blank">named colors</a>.
2. While you're playing with CSS, try experimenting with other styles! If you break something, it's not a big deal. Just undo your changes and keep playing!
3. Head off to the team chat, and share your creation with your team! The team chat is perfect for informal conversations like this one. Check out their creations too. Do you have anything in common?

## How Grading Works
We have created a document that gives rubric specific instructions to help you grade this project.You can access the document here: [About Me - Best Practices](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Iapz49Mwj2L7DCuGBOimiioZFoMl9XjvdHAVwWKuQQ/pub?embedded=true)

It is VERY IMPORTANT that you read this document before you begin evaluating projects. Ensure you work with the guidelines given in the document for each evaluation.

The difficulty level of this project is intentionally very low and the intent is not to challenge the student but to ensure they have a positive experience and are comfortable with the project submission and feedback process. When providing feedback on this project, ensure that feedback is friendly and encouraging in tone.

## Evaluation
Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer for general feedback only, it will not be evaluated for meeting specific technical expectations.
