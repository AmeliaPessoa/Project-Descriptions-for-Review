## For Reviewers
### How Grading Works
We have created a document that gives rubric specific instructions to help you grade this project.You can access the document here: [About Me - Best Practices](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e9fsgV46AflUxCIqSsQm9dA7WoB9LN1AnLAkB7-Bs8o/pub)

The difficulty level of this project is intentionally very low and the intent is not to challenge the student but to ensure they have a positive experience and are comfortable with the project submission and feedback process. When providing feedback on this project, ensure that feedback is friendly and encouraging in tone.

It is VERY IMPORTANT that you read this document before you begin evaluating projects. To meet specifications, all reviews must follow these guidelines.

## Project Overview

You will get acquainted with your text editor, structure and syntax of HTML and CSS, have a chance to go through the code review process, and interact with your classmates in the Discussion Forums and team chat!

### What will I learn?

You will learn how to create and edit text files within your text editor, basic HTML to display a web page, and how to properly establish relative links between files.

### Why is this important to my career?

* As a Front-End Web Developer, your text editor is the most important tool in your toolbox.
* Using your text editor efficiently to create and edit files is the most basic and frequently accomplished task day to day.
* Properly understanding how directory/folder structures work and how to relatively link files are key to maintaining a well organized application.

##Project Details

###How to complete Step 1

1. To start off, you need to download the site's source code, which you can find in the **Downloadables** section below. It's a zip file, so download it and unzip it somewhere you can easily find it on your computer.

2. Once you've unzipped the file, double click on `index.html`, which will open in your web browser. Opening `index.html` in your browser is just like navigating to the website online.  You'll see what it actually looks like. (You can also open `index.html` by going to the File menu in your browser, clicking Open and navigating to `index.html`.)

###How to Complete Step 2

For this part of the project, you'll be personalizing the website with some information about yourself.

1. To edit the website, you need to use a text editor. There are LOTS of different text editors. Most people try out a few and pick one that they really like to use all the time. If you're on a Mac, you can use the built-in TextEdit program. On Windows, there's Notepad. While those built-in editors are useful, they aren't made for code. We recommend using a program like <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a> to edit code because it's easy to use and gives you lots of helpful hints. This is a good time to go ahead and download it.

2. Start by opening index.html using a text editor. You can simply open up your text editor of choice and drag and drop the file into the editor. Or you can go to the file menu and choose open.
Now that you've opened `index.html` in a text editor, you’re looking at a website the way web developers do. But it probably doesn't look like a website you’re familiar with. Instead of pretty pictures and nicely formatted text, you're looking at an HTML document. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Notice the word “markup.” In the programming world, “markup” refers to a text document that has instructions describing how something else should look. In this case, the markup describes what will appear on a website. Scroll down in the HTML to find something that looks like this: `[Your name]`. Replace it with your name (line 21) and save your `index.html` file.


### How to Complete Step 3
###Personalization Options
1. Find all of the placeholder texts and replace them with your own answers! Write a little about yourself, because you'll be sharing this site with your group mates later in the project.
2. Find a picture of you online and replace the placeholder image with it! You can do this by changing the URL in quotes in line 15. The image should be small and square, no bigger than 300x300px.
3. Save your index.html file then refresh your browser to see what those changes do to your site.
4. Try changing other pieces of text in the HTML. What happens? And don't worry if you break anything because you can always undo your way back to safety :)

###How to Complete Step 4

How do you add CSS to this website? Start with the forum, which is a great resource. There you can look through posts other people in your Nanodegree have made for ideas about how to approach problems, or you can create your own posts to solicit help if you and your teammates (you'll learn about them soon!) want additional insight. 

1. Check out the discussion forum post called <a href="https://discussions.udacity.com/t/p0-about-me-post-here/24941" target="_blank">Project 0: About Me CSS Steps</a> and copy the line of code that you find.

2. The forum post will tell you where the code goes in your site. Paste the code in and watch what happens when you refresh the page!

When your website is styled, move on to Step 5 to fix a small bug with the style of the image.

###How to Complete Step 5

1. Open `styles.css` in your text editor.

2. You should see a few blocks of code. Find the block that starts with `.my-picture` (line 81). This block of CSS styles your picture in the middle of the page.

3. See how there's a line that says `width: 100%;`? This style says that the picture should be displayed as large as possible inside its container on the page. Right now, its container is that dark blue bar, so the image is trying to take up as much space as it can inside.

4. Change `width` to `max-width`. `max-width` sets a boundary on how large an image can be without *actually* resizing the image. In other words, `max-width: 100%;` will prevent the image from overflowing the dark blue bar, but it won't force the image to expand its width past its natural width.

5. Refresh the page and see what happens!


###How to Complete Step 6

1. Now that you have the styles for the page, customize some colors! Go into `styles.css` and change the color of the colored bar in the middle of the screen. Do it by going into the `.hero` block and changing the `background-color`. You can use <a href="http://www.color-hex.com/" target="_blank">hex colors</a>, <a href="http://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.htm" target="_blank">rgb colors</a>, or <a href="http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/color.html" target="_blank">named colors</a>.

2. While you're playing with CSS, try experimenting with other styles! If you break something, it's not a big deal. Just undo your changes and keep playing!

3. <b>Head off to <a href="https://discussions.udacity.com/c/nd001-intro-project" target="_blank">the forum</a> to share your creation with your  classmates</b>! Take a look at the instructor notes below to see how to use CodePen to do this. The forum is also the perfect place to go whenever you get stuck, want to ask a questions, share an accomplishment (like this one!), or just connect with your community. Check out your classmates' creations, too! Do you have anything in common? 

Happy with the results? Go to the next part of the project for submission instructions.


# Evaluation and Submission
## Evaluation
Project rubrics are used by code reviewers to determine if a project meets specifications. For this project, we encourage you to follow all the steps given in the instructions on this and the following page tabs. The project will meet specifications according to the following rubric:

![Image of Rubric](http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EVnjsnZ2uLjNkARuvHhb4TJXv8X_YbLzHIQ_h9YgmuJp6Dc5c2h1VLICSnAKLzhrHklTgFISx55-bojrB_c=s0#w=875&h=320)

You're going to start by working on a website. By the end of this project, it'll look something like this:

![Image of finished project](https://udacity.github.io/project-nautilus-project-0/images/project-final.png)

But right now, it looks like this (Try it at home!):

![Image of starting project](https://udacity.github.io/project-nautilus-project-0/images/project-start.png)

It's your job to personalize the site, fix a few bugs and customize it.
