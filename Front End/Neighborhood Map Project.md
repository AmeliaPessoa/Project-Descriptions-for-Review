## Project Overview
You will develop a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

## How will I complete this Project?
1. Review our course [JavaScript Design Patterns](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud989-nd).
2. Download the [Knockout framework](http://knockoutjs.com/).
3. Write code required to add a full-screen map to your page using the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/).
4. Write code required to add map markers identifying a number of locations your are interested in within this neighborhood.
5. Implement the search bar functionality to search your map markers.
6. Implement a list view of the identified locations.
7. Add additional functionality using third-party APIs when a map marker, search result, or list view entry is clicked (ex. Yelp reviews, Wikipedia, StreetView/Flickr images, etc). If you need a refresher on making AJAX requests to third-party servers, check out our [Intro to AJAX](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud110-nd) course.
