## Public Transportation App

Prepare for this project with [Building Offline-First Apps](https://www.udacity.com/ud899).

### Requirements

You must build an application that allows users to select a departure and arrival train station, and see a list of trains, times, and durations. Initially, the application should load a default train schedule - many public transportation agencies offer this information via an API or as a GTFS file (for example, [CalTrain](http://www.caltrain.com/developer.html) or the [My511.org transit data feed](http://511.org/developer-resources_transit-data-feed.asp)). If the application is online, your schedule should reflect real-time transit data, informing the user of any delays they may encounter.

### Evaluation

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to the rubric below. Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.
