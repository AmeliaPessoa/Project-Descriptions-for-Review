## Meet-Up Event Planner

### Requirements

_You do not need to create a functioning back-end or save user information. Only the form components themselves and their performance will be evaluated._

1) You do not need to create a real back-end or save user information, but the app must provide a form for users to create an account. Account creation should include, but is not limited to:

* Name
* Email address
* Secure password (with character and length requirements)
* Optional public biographical information (such as employer, job title, birthday, etc)

2) The app should allow users to create a new event. Each event should, at a minimum, allow a user to set:

* Name of the event
* Type of the event (birthday party, conference talk, wedding, etc.)
* Event host (could be an individual’s name or an organization)
* Event start date and time
* Event end date and time
* Guest list
* Location
* Optional message to the guests with additional information about the event

3) The app should display events that have been created.

### Tips, Tricks, and Advice

* You may find that you want to save user information in some way, as opposed to just hard-coding in a few events to meet the “display events” requirement. You could accomplish this by using [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage) or by using a “back-end as a service” platform like [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/).
* You can use any framework you’d like - or don’t! It’s up to you.
