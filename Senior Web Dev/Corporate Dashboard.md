## Corporate Dashboard

Prepare for this project with [Component-Oriented Development](https://www.udacity.com/ud895).

### Requirements

You must develop a corporate dashboard application in a component-oriented manner. The dashboard application must contain a header (with the currently selected dashboard’s name); a menu, allowing the user to navigate between dashboards; and the primary dashboard display area. You should find, or create, your own data files in CSV and JSON formats to provide data to the components. The components must be declaratively configurable (colors, titles, data file, etc.). The required dashboards are:

1. A geospatial view, identifying the number of employees at various company locations.
2. A “key metrics” view, containing components displaying: the number of open issues, a line chart reflecting number of paying customers over a period of time, and a bar chart reflecting number of reported issues over a period of time.
3. A “data view” of all issues, with an appearance similar to a spreadsheet, that is sortable and filterable. An issue should contain the following fields:
* submission timestamp
* customer name
* customer email address
* description
* open/closed status
* closed timestamp
* employee name

### Evaluation

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to the rubric below. Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.
