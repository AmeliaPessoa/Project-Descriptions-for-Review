## Restaurant Reviews App

Prepare for this project with [Accessible Web Applications](https://www.udacity.com/ud891).

### Requirements

You must build a restaurant reviews application with a focus on accessibility. The application must include restaurant names, a photograph, address and operating hours for each restaurant along with reviews, including the name of the reviewer, date of review, 5-star rating system, and comments. The application must include an application header, a menu providing multiple ways to filter the restaurants. When viewing a specific restaurant, current reviews must be displayed along with a form for the user to submit their own review.

### Evaluation

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to the rubric below. Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.
