Marketing and Distribution Final Project Reviewer Guideline
=============================================

## Context

This project is the fourth project for Tech Entrepreneur students. Previous to this project the students should have refined their ideas through user research. Through the Marketing course, students should have learned more about the potential market for their idea. Please remember Tech Entrepreneur students come from a diverse background of varying writing and business skills. As such, please include thorough and detailed comments where applicable.

Course materials can be found [here.]()

## Project Description

The student is expected to have submitted a detailed marketing plan that includes:

* a value proposition
* a target audience and market segment
* analysis of competitors
* marketing goals
* a distribution plan

The reviewer is expected to fully read the student's prepared marketing plan, paying attention to things such as spelling, grammer, content, and clarity, as well as providing constructive feedback that will further enhance the student's learning.

<!--Here is an example <project href = ...>.-->

## Project Specification

### 1 - Content Review
	
#### Value Proposition
Students have been encouraged to use a template value proposition created by Geoffrey Moore. You can find the template [here.] 
(https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1znQNAigOifBte1c2BC8q-RsD9O_6c3p9dUL-URkpbSM/edit#slide=id.g66e7ffd40_0_13)

The student's value proposition must communicate both the problem/need present in the market and how the product addresses that problem/need. Since this is the central concept behind the marketing plan please take a critical look at the value proposition and determine if the student is _creating_ a problem for a solution they have, or if their product addresses and _solves_ a problem. They should be addressing a problem that exists in the market.

#### Competitive Analysis
The student is to conduct a competitive analysis using a 2x2 grid such as the one provided [here.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1znQNAigOifBte1c2BC8q-RsD9O_6c3p9dUL-URkpbSM/edit#slide=id.g66e7ffd40_0_0)

Within the matrix a student needs to provide the following:

* two descriptors (i.e. price, quality, benefit to customer) that differentiates the product
* having the two descriptors along the two axes of the matrix
* a good representation of competitor products that belong to certain sides of the axes.

Make sure the students provide legitimate competitors and their products in the matrix. If you are unfamiliar with the market the product is in, please look up the companies the students list and see if they align with how the student has them in the matrix.

#### Market Segmentation and Selection
The student needs to select a market segment that reflects the problem they are addressing. A persona for a user in this segment needs to be described using the following characteristics:

* a name and picture
* demographic information 
* geographic information
* behavioral or psychographic information  
* needs and wants 

Remember to keep in mind that the persona described needs to have the problem/need the product addresses.
#### Marketing Goals
The student needs to provide 2-3 marketing goals for the product that can be accomplished in roughly a year. Make sure these goals have specific ways of measuring the progress and success of the goal. For each goal a student must provide a Key Performance Indicator (KPI).

#### Distribution Plan
The distribution plan must have three core parts: a social media plan, growth hacking plan, and a product landing page. The purpose of the social media plan is to develop the student's ability to communicate to the public about their product in a concise, clear manner. The growth hacking plan provides the student with an opportunity to think creatively about promoting the product. The landing page is to be evaluated on its ability to garner attention, communicate the product, and encourage conversion. Below are more detailed requirements for each core area.

Social Media:

* three social media channels and a written communication slide for each
* the communication slide needs to include the text, images, URLs, and any other resource needed for each post
* the student needs to use the language and format of the media platform appropriately (hashtags, number of characters, etc.)
* the social media plan is drafted out for at least 3 months

Growth Hacking:

* the student will provide one slide on the topic
* on the slide innovative and scalable means to promote and distribute the product must be discussed
* the student should have at least 3 months worth of growth hacking planned

Landing Page:

* name of company or app 
* a clear action item for users 
* description of what the product offers
* description of what value the product holds for customers

### 2 - Plan Overview
As you review the student's marketing plan please address both the individual requirements for each section while additionally keeping the broad scope of the product in mind. 

For example, a student may have an awesome value proposition but the value proposition is not communicated well on their landing page. How would you advise that student to best modify the landing page? 

Overall, make sure each component of the marketing plan reasonably advances the student's understanding of the market they serve, their place in the market, and how to create a space in the market to attract customers.

### 2. Writeup Review

#### Use of Proper Spelling/Grammer

We are encouraging students to develop professional-level writing skills so please comment whenever the following may occur:

* Spelling errors
* Run-on sentences
* Pronoun errors
* Misplaced modifiers
* Subject-verb disagreements
* Apostrophe usage

#### Clarity of Writing

The student should accurately and clearly describe specific aspects and details of the marketing plan. Please comment whenever the student's use of words causes confusion.

## Watch Outs

If the student submits files and links that are unreadable or cannot be commented on easily, please mark the project as ungradeable and encourage the student to use written formats that are more universally acceptable such as PDFs, JPG, GIF, Google Docs, Webpage, etc.
