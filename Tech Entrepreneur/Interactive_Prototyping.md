Interactive Prototyping Final Project Reviewer Guideline
=============================================

## Context

This project is the third project for Tech Entrepreneur students. Previous to this project the students should have refined their ideas through user research. This course teaches students the importance of the prototyping process, specifically that consistent interaction with potential users will guide the design. Please remember Tech Entrepreneur students come from a diverse background of varying writing and business skills. As such, please include thorough and detailed comments where applicable.

Course materials can be found [here.]()

## Project Description

The student is expected to discuss and develop the following for their project:

* Description of a problem
* Low-fidelity prototype
* Conduct UX research with the low-fidelity prototype
* Use results from the UX research to form a medium-fidelity prototype
* Do a write-up regarding the user interactions that occurred during the UX research

This project has two main components to review: the submitted PDF document that provides the written portion of the project, and a link to the design prototypes which will be hosted as an InVision project. Both aspects of this project are very important. But, since the InVision prototype is hosted on a separate domain we cannot provide a convenient way for reviewers to add comments. Because of this, reviewers are encouraged to take screenshots of the prototype and annotate comments in that manner.

The reviewer is expected to fully read the student's progression through their design and examine the design prototype, paying attention to things such as spelling, grammer, content, and clarity, as well as providing constructive feedback that will further enhance the student's learning.

## Project Specification

### 1 - Content Review

#### Problem description
The student is expected to provide a clear description of a problem that their app helps to solve. The student needs to make a clear difference between the existing problem, how/why the problem occurs, and what the app provides that is new or better.

#### How the problem and design interact
Students are expected to provide both a low-fidelity and medium-fidelity prototype. The low-fidelity prototype will be needed for the student to get user input and modify their design up to a medium-fidelity prototype.

For the low-fidelity prototype the student may submit pictures or scanned drawings. Medium-fidelity prototypes will be submitted as an InVision link. To better help distinguish the difference between low and medium-fidelity prototypes consider the following:

* Low-fidelity prototypes consist of drawings of each app scene with the design and example content clearly provided. For a given app scene a list of interaction points are to be provided to describe how users would interact with the design. The purpose of the low-fidelity prototype is to get beginning results from user research so that the design may be iterated upon to test improvements.

* Medium-fidelity prototypes are the result of the progressions that took place with the user research and the low-fidelity prototypes. The medium-fidelity prototype needs to be interactive and allow users to click or tap on elements on the screen to allow navigation between scenes and other basic app operations. The medium-fidelity prototype is useful in user research to determine how potential users will interact with the app given no guidance from the researcher.


#### If results from the UX research is reflected in the updated prototypes
When the student identifies key items that were brought up during the user research, please be sure to compare their low and medium-fidelity prototypes to determine if they made changes based on feedback. Ask yourself these questions. Did the student's design change? Is there a clear understanding on the student's side that aspects of their low-fidelity prototype were flawed and were then improved upon with the medium-fidelity one? Be sure to comment whenever a student clearly identifies an issue a user brought up but then their prototype updates never addressed the issue.

#### The provided medium-fidelity prototype has a clear user flow and has clickable/interactive features
When evaluating the student's InVision prototype first approach it as a potential user. What does the prototype communicate to you? Is the purpose of the app clear? Are their any interaction points that do not work or that lead you to the wrong place (i.e. you click on Settings and it takes you to the Home screen)? Can you navigate the app easily? If you were a user that wanted to perform a key task in the app can you reasonably believe you could do it without guidance?

After you analyze the app as a user then go ahead and proceed and consider the user flow as a whole. Was the progression smooth? Is the order of the app scenes appropriate? Should more/less scenes be included to make the app content less cluttered? Is content consistent and are there focal points per app scene?

### 2 - Plan Overview

The purpose of this project is to provide students real-life experience starting from a basic sketch of how their app will function. Feedback from user research will drive the design and workings of the app to the next level of fidelity. Students need to demonstrate a focused effort obtaining user feedback. If you are concerned that a student picked users that do not fit the problem description they provided, please comment and tell the student. When the student takes the user research and transforms that into the medium-fidelity prototype, encourage the student to pay attention to detail and how they can update aspects of the app to better accomodate their users.

#### Use of Proper Spelling/Grammer

We are encouraging students to develop professional-level writing skills for the tech industry so please comment whenever the following may occur:

* Spelling errors
* Run-on sentences
* Pronoun errors
* Misplaced modifiers
* Subject-verd disagreements
* Apostrophe usage

#### Clarity of Writing

The student should accurately and clearly describe specific aspects and details of the prototyping process and their user research. Please comment whenever the student's use of words causes confusion.

## Watch Outs

### Submission Format

Students have been instructed to submit their plans in PDF format. Additionally, in the PDF document the student should provide a link to their prototype. This prototype may be in InVision. However, depending on the nature of the student's work or their idea a different format may be submitted. If a student submits the project in a format that renders it difficult to add comments to, please contact reviews@udacity.com post in the Grader community page for guidance.
