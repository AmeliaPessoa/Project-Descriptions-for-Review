# Crystallize Your Progress
## Evaluation

Use the [**Project Rubric**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vk1pa3Io9bq0UCmHSimjgXZwSyadt6o613hivZcOoHQ/pub) to review your project. If you are happy with your submission, then you are ready to submit! If you see room for improvement in **any** category in which you do not meet specifications, keep working! 

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to the same [**Project Rubric**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vk1pa3Io9bq0UCmHSimjgXZwSyadt6o613hivZcOoHQ/pub). Your project must "meet specifications" in each category in order for your submission to pass.

## Note to Reviewer

Students must follow the writing format we provided in the submission section below. If the student does not follow the format, the project is deemed ungradeable.

We want to give you and the student a common writing format to follow to help set appropriate expectations of what exactly we're looking for in the student's write up and to allow you to efficiently evaluate these submissions.
