#Crystallize Your Progress

Here's an outline you can use to help guide your project.  This outline contains each of the pieces necessary to meet specifications on the project.

## Note to Reviewer

Students must follow the writing format we provided in the outline section below. If the student does not follow the format, the project is deemed ungradeable.
