===

## Context

This project is the final project for Tech Entrepreneur students. This capstone project involves creating a presentation to help the student tell his/her story to potential investors, incubators, accelerators, and friends and family. Please remember Tech Entrepreneur students come from a diverse background of varying writing and business skills. As such, please include thorough and detailed comments where applicable.

<!--Course materials can be found [here.]()-->

## Project Description

The project asks students to put everything together into a succinct presentation that outlines their research and prototypes they've built throughout the Tech Entrepreneur Nanodegree program. Students need to submit a presentation with supporting documentation (e.g. research, user feedback, market analysis, etc.) The supporting documentation is an optional component to submit, but is highly encouraged.


## Project Specification

### 1 - Content Review

#### Key Points in the Story

The actual presentation medium is up to the student. The most common presentation formats you'll see will be PDF of their deck if it was created in Powerpoint, Keynote, or some other presentation software, an investor page, or a video that outlines these key points in their story:

1. Problem 
2. Solution
3. Market Size
4. Product
4. User Validation / Feedback
5. Monetization Strategy / Business Model
6. Competitive Analysis 
7. Marketing and Distribution Plan
8. Team
9. Next Steps

Make sure that students adequately cite their key points. Appendices or links to their sources should be in their presentation.

**Important**: You should make sure that you **only** grade the presentation to have these key points with adequate citation. Anything else that you grade can be highly subjective. Therefore we highly encourage you to give tips and feedback on the flow of their presentation as well or any other aspect of their presentation to improve it.

#### Narration Availability

On top of their presentation, students need to submit a copy of exactly what they plan to talk about in their presentation.

#### Communication Level

You will read their narration and make sure that they hit all of their key points succinctly and make sure that they answer this question on every slide: "So what?" Many students will focus too much on the technical details so if you feel that the student focuses too much on the technical details in their presentation, please comment and guide the student to focus on their product story. Make sure that the students talk about the big ideas first per slide.

Furthermore, the presentation should be simple and clear enough that a general audience can understand all key points. 

#### Concise

It should take you no more than 20 minutes to go through the entire presentation from start to finish including any additional documentation the student may have submitted.

#### Presentation Format

Students are encouraged to be creative in their presentation formats. Expect the majority of students to submit:

1. presentation slides
2. landing page
3. video

Above all, the format should allow the student to deliver a clear and concise story to the audience.

#### Supporting Documentation (Optional)

Students are encouraged to submit their support documentation along with their presentation. The support documentation can contain one or more of the following:

1. Design sprint research
2. Detail on monetization plan and/or projections
3. Iterative prototype versions, a log of what changed, and detailed user feedback
4. Market and competitive research

Please go through this documentation as well and comment their ability to communicate their research and give them tips to improve their support documentation to allow a general audience to dive deep into their research.

### 2. Writeup Review

#### Use of Proper Spelling/Grammer

We are encouraging students to develop professional-level writing skills so please comment whenever the following may occur:

* Spelling errors
* Run-on sentences
* Pronoun errors
* Misplaced modifiers
* Subject-verb disagreements
* Apostrophe usage

**Important**: Students should write in full sentences! Students should communicate their complete clearly and concisely as much as possible by using fully complete sentences.

#### Clarity of Writing

The student should accurately and clearly describe specific aspects and details of the support documentation or presentation. Please comment whenever the student's use of words causes confusion.

## Watch Outs

If the student submits files and links that are unreadable or unwatchable, or cannot be commented on easily, please mark the project as ungradeable and encourage the student to use written formats that are more universally acceptable such as PDFs, Google Docs, Prezi, YouTube, Vimeo, Webpage, etc.
