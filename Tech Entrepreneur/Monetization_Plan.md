Monetization Plan Final Project Reviewer Guideline
===

## Context

This project is the second project for Tech Entrepreneur students. Previous to this project, the student should have validated their idea with users from the Product Design class. Please remember Tech Entrepreneur students come from a diverse background of varying writing and business skills. As such, please include thorough and detailed comments where applicable.

## Project Description

This project require students to come up with a plan to make money off their product. Students need to submit a writeup that contains:

* Monetization Summary (max 250 words):

    * What is the problem they’re solving?
    * What is their solution?
    * What is their monetization strategy?
  
* Monetization Details: Go deep on their chosen monetization strategy and rationale.

* KPIs: What they plan to measure, their rationale for those metrics, and their definition of success for those metrics. 

* Plan B: What they'll do if their first monetization strategy doesn’t succeed.


## Project Specification

### Note on Word Limits

Summaries will have word limits, usually 250 words or 100 words.

Please count how many words the student uses for each summary. We want to teach the student that she needs to write succinctly. 

Therefore if the student goes over her word limit by a couple of words, it is okay. Do not fail the student if she went over the word limit by 5 words. There is a hard number though and if the student is over 15 words in her summary (such as 115 or 265) do not pass the student. Suggest to the student how she can shorten her summary.

### 1 - Content Review

#### Written Summary

The summary needs to clearly articulate the three key points mentioned above.

#### Monetization Details

The key point to look for in this is the student's ability to justify the their monetization plans with their product. Below is an example of good justification:

> The super duper shopping app helps people buy things online. We plan to take 1% of the total price every time people order off our app.

Below is an example of bad justification because the monetization strategy does not make any rationale sense given a product and anticipated user behavior:

> The super duper shopping app helps people buy things online. We plan to make sell our users Netflix subscriptions.

Students are encouraged to identify the barriers to monetization and come up with plans to reduce these barriers.

#### KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)

KPIs measure how well a business achieves its key objectives. Therefore the student must define their key business objectives in first in order to define their KPIs appropriately. KPIs indicate where actions should be taken in the business in order to drive key objectives and not simply a report of the current state of the business.

Here is an example of a KPI: Number of user installations per 15 days
Here is an example of a static metric: Revenue generated in the past 15 days

With the KPI mentioned above, if the numbers of users drop, the business can focus in on why users dropped and start taking action to drive the number of user installations back up again. The static metric doesn't allow a business to recognize where to take action if revenue starts falling.

Make sure that students define appropriate KPIs that are well justified with the student's product in mind.

Further explanations about KPIs can be found here in this [video morsel](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud518-nd/l-4638318691/e-4643418871/m-4643418872)

**Example**

Let's break down the KPI "Gain 10% new paying customers every month" to clearly define what is a metric, what is the KPI, what is the goal this KPI is driving. Let's work backwards and think of our goal first:

**Goal:** Gain 1000 paying customers by June, 2016

This tells us that we want to have 1000 paying customers by June, 2016. The more paying customers we have means that we are driving revenue. Notice how we add in a time to complete this goal. We are binding this goal to a time to ensure that we stay accountable and not waste time to growing 1000 customers by June, 2016. Goals need to be time-bound.

How will we measure progress up to June, 2016? We need a metric that can help us measure the number of paying customers in any given month.

**Metric:** Percent of Paying Customers for any given month

This is the actual value that we can objectively measure. We will use this metric in order to create our KPI.

**KPI:** Grow 10% new Paying Customers every month

In order to grow our paying customer base to 1000 by June, 2016, we want to see how well we are growing paying customer base every month. This KPI tells us that we want to grow our customer base by 10% every month. We assume that we have enough total users that can convert to 1000 paying customers by June, 2016.

Therefore the KPI is a measurement of progress or a milestone that we can constantly check every month to ensure that we are going in the right direction to achieve our goal of attaining 1000 paying customers by June, 2016.

#### Plan B

Students also need to write up a back up plan if their monetization strategies do not work.

### 2. Writeup Review

#### Use of Proper Spelling/Grammer

We are encouraging students to develop professional-level writing skills so please comment whenever the following may occur:

* Spelling errors
* Run-on sentences
* Pronoun errors
* Misplaced modifiers
* Subject-verb disagreements
* Apostrophe usage

#### Clarity of Writing

The student should accurately and clearly describe specific aspects and details of the monetization plan. Please comment whenever the student's use of words causes confusion.

## Watch Outs

If the student submits files and links that are unreadable, please mark the project as ungradeable and encourage the student to use written formats that are more universally acceptable such as PDFs, JPG, GIF, Google Docs, Webpage, etc.
