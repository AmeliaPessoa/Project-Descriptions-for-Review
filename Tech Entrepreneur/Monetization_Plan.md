Monetization Plan Final Project Reviewer Guideline
===

## Context

This project is the second project for Tech Entrepreneur students. Previous to this project, the student should have validated their idea with users from the Product Design class. Please remember Tech Entrepreneur students come from a diverse background of varying writing and business skills. As such, please include thorough and detailed comments where applicable.

## Project Description

This project require students to come up with a plan to make money off their product. Students need to submit a writeup that contains:

* Monetization Summary (max 250 words):

    * What is the problem they’re solving?
    * What is their solution?
    * What is their monetization strategy?
  
* Monetization Details: Go deep on their chosen monetization strategy and rationale.

* KPIs: What they plan to measure, their rationale for those metrics, and their definition of success for those metrics. 

* Plan B: What they'll do if their first monetization strategy doesn’t succeed.


## Project Specification

### Note on Word Limits

Summaries will have word limits, usually 250 words or 100 words.

Please count how many words the student uses for each summary. We want to teach the student that she needs to write succinctly. 

Therefore if the student goes over her word limit by a couple of words, it is okay. Do not fail the student if she went over the word limit by 5 words. There is a hard number though and if the student is over 15 words in her summary (such as 115 or 265) do not pass the student. Suggest to the student how she can shorten her summary.

### 1 - Content Review

#### Written Summary

The summary needs to clearly articulate the three key points mentioned above.

#### Monetization Details

The key point to look for in this is the student's ability to justify the their monetization plans with their product. Below is an example of good justification:

> The super duper shopping app helps people buy things online. We plan to take 1% of the total price every time people order off our app.

Below is an example of bad justification because the monetization strategy does not make any rationale sense given a product and anticipated user behavior:

> The super duper shopping app helps people buy things online. We plan to make sell our users Netflix subscriptions.

Students are encouraged to identify the barriers to monetization and come up with plans to reduce these barriers.

#### KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)

KPIs measure how well a business achieves its key objectives. Therefore the student must define their key business objectives in first in order to define their KPIs appropriately. KPIs indicate where actions should be taken in the business in order to drive key objectives and not simply a report of the current state of the business.

Here is an example of a KPI: Number of user installations per 15 days
Here is an example of a static metric: Revenue generated in the past 15 days

With the KPI mentioned above, if the numbers of users drop, the business can focus in on why users dropped and start taking action to drive the number of user installations back up again. The static metric doesn't allow a business to recognize where to take action if revenue starts falling.

Make sure that students define appropriate KPIs that are well justified with the student's product in mind.

<u>*Goals*</u>

Furthermore, the student should explicitely write their KPI goals over some period of time such as 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, etc. Below are examples:

* More than YY% of your users are paying customers for any given month
* Number of paid subscriptions is growing week over week by ZZ%
* Each user brings in $XXX.XX month in ad revenue a month
* One out of every XYZ customers will buy a product/service through your affiliate network whenever she uses your app.
* More than YY% of your users will buy credits through your game for every X plays.

#### Plan B

Students also need to write up a back up plan if their monetization strategies do not work.

### 2. Writeup Review

#### Use of Proper Spelling/Grammer

We are encouraging students to develop professional-level writing skills so please comment whenever the following may occur:

* Spelling errors
* Run-on sentences
* Pronoun errors
* Misplaced modifiers
* Subject-verb disagreements
* Apostrophe usage

#### Clarity of Writing

The student should accurately and clearly describe specific aspects and details of the monetization plan. Please comment whenever the student's use of words causes confusion.

## Watch Outs

If the student submits files and links that are unreadable, please mark the project as ungradeable and encourage the student to use written formats that are more universally acceptable such as PDFs, JPG, GIF, Google Docs, Webpage, etc.
