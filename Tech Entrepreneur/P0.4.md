#Build a Prototype

**Here's an outline you can use to help guide your project.  This outline contains each of the pieces necessary to meet specifications on the project.**

## Note to Reviewer

Students must follow the writing format we provided in the outline section below. If the student does not follow the format, the project is deemed ungradeable.

We want to give you and the student a common writing format to follow to help set appropriate expectations of what exactly we're looking for in the student's write up and to allow you to efficiently evaluate these submissions.

##Limitations

* Did you get feedback that answers the questions you started out with?
* Does the feedback overall say you're going in the right direction?
* In 3-4 sentences, have you come across any limitations when using a low-fidelity prototype?  What do you hope to accomplish with a higher fidelity prototype?
