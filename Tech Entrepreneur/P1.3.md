# Find Your Target Audience
## Evaluation

Use the [**Project Rubric**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bRwQHkbC_VOmsmBB8F_oozVsd9l5o62X_Pje1sTaJTM/pub) to review your project. If you are happy with your submission, then you are ready to submit! If you see room for improvement in **any** category in which you do not meet specifications, keep working! 

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to the same [**Project Rubric**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bRwQHkbC_VOmsmBB8F_oozVsd9l5o62X_Pje1sTaJTM/pub). Your project must "meet specifications" in each category in order for your submission to pass.
