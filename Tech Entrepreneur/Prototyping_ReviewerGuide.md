Interactive Prototyping Final Project Reviewer Guideline
=============================================

## Context

This project is the third project for Tech Entrepreneur students. Previous to this project the students should have refined their ideas through user research. This course teaches students the importance of the prototyping process, specifically that consistent interaction with potential users will guide the design. Please remember Tech Entrepreneur students come from a diverse background of varying writing and business skills. As such, please include thorough and detailed comments where applicable.

## Project Description

The student is expected to discuss and develop the following for their project:

* Description of a problem
* Low-fidelity prototype
* Conduct UX research with the low-fidelity prototype
* Use results from the UX research to form a medium-fidelity prototype
* Do a write-up regarding the user interactions that occurred during the UX research

This project has two main components to review: the submitted PDF document that provides the written portion of the project, and a link to the design prototypes which will be hosted as an InVision project. Both aspects of this project are very important. But, since the InVision prototype is hosted on a separate domain we cannot provide a convenient way for reviewers to add comments. Because of this, reviewers are encouraged to take screenshots of the prototype and annotate comments in that manner.

The reviewer is expected to fully read the student's progression through their design and examine the design prototype, paying attention to things such as spelling, grammer, content, and clarity, as well as providing constructive feedback that will further enhance the student's learning.

## Project Specification

### 1 - Content Review

#### Problem description


#### How the problem and design interact


#### If results from the UX research is reflected in the updated prototypes


#### The provided medium-fidelity prototype has a clear user flow and has clickable/interactive features


### 2 - Plan Overview

Reviewers will read the marketing plan and provide feedback on:

#### Use of Proper Spelling/Grammer

We are encouraging students to develop professional-level writing skills for the tech industry so please comment whenever the following may occur:

	* Spelling errors
	* Run-on sentences
	* Pronoun errors
	* Misplaced modifiers
	* Subject-verd disagreements
	* Apostrophe usage

#### Clarity of Writing

The student should accurately and clearly describe specific aspects and details of the marketing plan. Please comment whenever the student's use of words causes confusion.

## Watch Outs

### Submission Format

Students have been instructed to submit their plans in PDF format. Additionally, in the PDF document the student should provide a link to their prototype. This prototype may be in InVision. However, depending on the nature of the student's work or their idea a different format may be submitted. If a student submits the project in a format that renders it difficult to add comments to, please contact reviews@udacity.com post in the Grader community page for guidance.
