# Project 5: Capstone Project
## Robot Motion Planning Track
### Plot and Navigate a Virtual Maze

The **Robot Motion Planning Track** Capstone Project is part of a number of suggested areas of research for the final project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. Below you will find a pre-constructed project which you may use to satisfy the Capstone Project requirement. The included resources are non-exhaustive and you are free to pursue your own research beyond what is provided. Before you begin, be sure that you are familiar with the [Capstone Project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/108/view), the [Capstone Project description](https://github.com/udacity/Project-Descriptions-for-Review/blob/master/Machine-Learning/Capstone%20Project/Capstone%20Project.md), and the [project report template](https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning/blob/master/projects/capstone/project_report_template.md). These resources will be necessary to complete the Capstone Project, regardless of which domain or problem you choose to work on.

### Project Description
This project takes inspiration from [Micromouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromouse) competitions, wherein a robot mouse is tasked with plotting a path from a corner of the maze to its center. The robot mouse may make multiple runs in a given maze. In the first run, the robot mouse tries to map out the maze to not only find the center, but also figure out the best paths to the center. In subsequent runs, the robot mouse attempts to reach the center in the fastest time possible, using what it has previously learned. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JCsRpcrk3s) is an example of a Micromouse competition. In this project, you will create functions to control a virtual robot to navigate a virtual maze. A simplified model of the world is provided along with specifications for the maze and robot; your goal is to obtain the fastest times possible in a series of test mazes.

### Project Setup
You will need the following packages and libraries to run the project code:
- Python 2.7
- NumPy

You can find the starter code for the project linked in an archive [here](https://drive.google.com/a/udacity.com/file/d/0B9Yf01UaIbUgQ2tjRHhKZGlHSzQ/view). The following files are included in the archive:
- `robot.py` - This Python file creates the robot class. This will be the only Python file that you will need to modify, and will be the main file that you submit as your project.
- `maze.py` - This Python file contains functionality for constructing a maze and for checking for walls upon robot movement or sensing.
- `tester.py` - This Python file will be run when the robot is to be tested for its ability to plot and navigate a maze.
- `showmaze.py` - This Python file can be used to create a visual representation of what a maze looks like from a given text file.
- `test_maze_##.txt` - Text files like this contain the information on a particular maze which the robot can be tested on. Three such sample mazes have been provided. Feel free to create more mazes using the specifications below.

To test your robot implementation, issue the following command from the command line (make sure that all project files are in the same directory):

`python tester.py test_maze_##.txt` (replace ## with the maze number of choice)

To visualize a maze you have created, or to demonstrate one of the sample mazes provided, issue the following command from the command line:

`python showmaze.py test_maze_##.txt` (replace ## with the maze number of choice)

### Environment Specifications
**Maze Specifications**

The maze exists on an `n x n` grid of squares, `n` even. The minimum value of `n` is twelve, the maximum sixteen. Along the outside perimeter of the grid, and on the edges connecting some of the internal squares, are walls that block all movement. The robot will start in the square in the bottom- left corner of the grid, facing upwards. The starting square will always have a wall on its right side (in addition to the outside walls on the left and bottom) and an opening on its top side. In the center of the grid is the goal room consisting of a `2 x 2` square; the robot must make it here from its starting square in order to register a successful run of the maze.

Mazes are provided to the system via text file. On the first line of the text file is a number describing the number of squares on each dimension of the maze n. On the following n lines, there will be n comma-delimited numbers describing which edges of the square are open to movement. Each number represents a four-bit number that has a bit value of 0 if an edge is closed (walled) and 1 if an edge is open (no wall); the 1s register corresponds with the upwards-facing side, the 2s register the right side, the 4s register the bottom side, and the 8s register the left side. For example, the number 10 means that a square is open on the left and right, with walls on top and bottom (`0*1 + 1*2 + 0*4 + 1*8 = 10`). Note that, due to array indexing, the first data row in the text file corresponds with the leftmost column in the maze, its first element being the starting square (bottom-left) corner of the maze. A demonstration of this scheme is as follows:

**Robot Specifications**

The robot can be considered to rest in the center of the square it is currently located in, and points in one of the cardinal directions of the maze. The robot has three obstacle sensors, mounted on the front of the robot, its right side, and its left side. Obstacle sensors detect the number of open squares in the direction of the sensor; for example, in its starting position, the robot’s left and right sensors will state that there are no open squares in those directions and at least one square towards its front. On each time step of the simulation, the robot may choose to rotate clockwise or counterclockwise ninety degrees, then move forwards or backwards a distance of up to three units. It is assumed that the robot’s turning and movement is perfect. If the robot tries to move into a wall, the robot stays where it is. After movement, one time step has passed, and the sensors return readings for the open squares in the robot’s new location and/or orientation to start the next time unit.

More technically, at the start of a time step the robot will receive sensor readings as a list of three numbers indicating the number of open squares in front of the left, center, and right sensors (in that order) to its `next_move` function. The `next_move` function must then return two values indicating the robot’s rotation and movement on that timestep. Rotation is expected to be an integer taking one of three values: -90, 90, or 0, indicating a counterclockwise, clockwise, or no rotation, respectively. Movement follows rotation, and is expected to be an integer in the range [-3, 3] inclusive. The robot will attempt to move that many squares forward (positive) or backwards (negative), stopping movement if it encounters a wall.
  
**Scoring**

On each maze, the robot must complete two runs. In the first run, the robot is allowed to freely roam the maze to build a map of the maze. It must enter the goal room at some point during its exploration, but is free to continue exploring the maze after finding the goal. After entering the goal room, the robot may choose to end its exploration at any time. The robot is then moved back to the starting position and orientation for its second run. Its objective now is to go from the start position to the goal room in the fastest time possible. The robot’s score for the maze is equal to the number of time steps required to execute the second run, plus one thirtieth the number of time steps required to execute the first run. A maximum of one thousand time steps are allotted to complete both runs for a single maze.

### Submitting your Project

Please refer to the [Capstone Project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/108/view) to self-evaluate your work before submitting. The following deliverables will be required as a single compressed archive:
- All of the necessary project code, datasets, supplementary files for your project
- Your project report as a PDF, which adheres to a similar structure of the [project report template](https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning/blob/master/projects/capstone/project_report_template.md)
- A README with title text **"Plot and Navigate a Virtual Maze"** along with instructions about running the code and acquiring datasets (if necessary).

**Report Structure**

Due to the nature of this project, the following rubric items will require specific responses in your report:
- **Data Exploration**: Use the robot specifications section to discuss how the robot will interpret and explore its environment. Additionally, one of the three mazes provided should be discussed in some detail, such as some interesting structural observations and one possible solution you have found to the goal (in number of steps). Try to aim for an optimal path, if possible!
- **Exploratory Visualization**: This section should correlate with the section above, in that you should provide a visualization of one of the three example mazes using the showmaze.py file. Your explanation in **Data Exploration** should coincide with the visual cues from this maze.
- **Benchmark**: You will need to decide what you feel is a reasonable benchmark score that you can compare your robot’s results on. Consider the visualization and data exploration above: If you are allowed one thousand time steps for exploring (run 1) and testing (run 2), and given the metric defined in the project, what is a reasonable score you might expect? There is no right or wrong answer here, but this will help with your discussion of solutions later on in the project.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Because there is no data preprocessing needed in this project (the sensor specification and environment designs are provided to you), be sure to mention that no data preprocessing was necessary and why this is true.
- **Free-Form Visualization**: Use this section to come up with your own maze. Your maze should have the same dimensions (12x12, 14x14, or 16x16) and have the goal and starting positions in the same locations as the three example mazes (you can use test_maze_01.txt as a template). Try to make a design that you feel may either reflect the robustness of your robot’s algorithm, or amplify a potential issue with the approach you used in your robot implementation. Provide a small discussion of the maze as well.
- **Improvement**: Consider if the scenario took place in a continuous domain. For example, each square has a unit length, walls are 0.1 units thick, and the robot is a circle of diameter 0.4 units. What modifications might be necessary to your robot’s code to handle the added complexity? Are there types of mazes in the continuous domain that could not be solved in the discrete domain? If you have ideas for other extensions to the current project, describe and discuss them here.
