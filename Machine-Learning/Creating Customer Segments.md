###Creating Customer Segments

You’ve been hired by a wholesale grocery distributor to help them conduct A/B tests. The last time they conducted an A/B test they changed their delivery method from a regular morning delivery to a cheaper, bulk evening delivery. The tests didn’t discover any significant effect, so they implemented the cheaper option. Almost immediately, they began getting complaints about the change and losing customers. As it turns out, the highest volume customers had an easy time adapting to the change, whereas smaller mom and pop shops had serious issues with it--but these issues were washed out statistically by noise from the larger customers.

For the future, what they want is to have a sense of what sorts of different customers they have, so that when implementing changes, they can look at the effects on these different groups independently. Your task is to use unsupervised techniques to see what sort of patterns exist amongst existing customers, and what exactly makes them different.
