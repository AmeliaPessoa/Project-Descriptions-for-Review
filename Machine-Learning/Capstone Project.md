## Machine Learning Capstone Project

In this capstone project, you will pick a problem of your choice that can be solved by applying machine learning. Be prepared to leverage algorithms and techniques you've learned throughout the Nanodegree program.

### Define your problem
Think about a problem domain that you are passionate about, e.g. healthcare, engineering, finance, robotics, marketing, bio-informatics, etc., something that excites you. Then choose an existing problem within that domain which you could solve by applying machine learning.

Look for challenges and datasets on platforms like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [Devpost](http://devpost.com/), etc. If you do find a problem you'd like to solve on one of these platforms, make sure to cite the source in your project report.

Once you have picked a problem, define it in clearly your report.

- _What is the problem you're trying to solve, why is it important to solve it?_
- _How does it affect people? How does it affect you?_
