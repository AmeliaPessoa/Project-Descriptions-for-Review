##Project Overview
With this first version of MemeMe, students will create an app that enables a user to take a picture, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme. The user will be able to share the photo on Facebook and Twitter and also by SMS or email. 

##Why this project?
MemeMe covers many of the major UI components found in essentially every app. It combines them with the camera and social media activity view to create a fun and personal user experience. 

##What Will I learn?
* Access the Camera and Photo Album using the UIImagePickerController
* Understand how Swift optionals, closures, collections, classes, structs and protocols are used in iOS apps
* Create Actions and Outlets with extremely high proficiency
* Use a UIActivityViewController to share media with Facebook, Twitter, SMS, and Email
* Describe the delegate pattern and give a full account of its importance and uses in iOS classes

##Why is this project meaningful to my career?
* Becoming comfortable using a variety of UIControls and stock view controllers is an essential step in becoming an iOS developer.
* Understanding UIKit allows a developer to make educated assumptions about the architecture of apps that they use. 
* Mastering UKit fundamentals frees a developer up to learn model-oriented skills like networking and persistence.
