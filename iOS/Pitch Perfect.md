##Project Overview
You will make an iPhone app that will allow users to record their voice and will then modulate the recorded audio to sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader. This app will also let the user speed up or slow down the rate of playback.
​
##Already done?
If you have successfully completed Pitch Perfect for the Intro to iOS App Development with Swift course in the past (which entails having graduated from the course and access to your course certificate), let us know by emailing **ios-project@udacity.com** with your passing evaluation. You won't be required to submit twice.
​
##Why this project?
The first step in becoming an iOS Developer is to create your first app. Pitch Perfect provides a substantial, while not overly complicated, introduction to the iOS ecosystem.
​
##What will I learn?
You will learn how to:
​
* Create a new project from existing iOS app templates using Swift 2.0
* Add buttons, images, labels and create user interfaces for the app using the Storyboard
* Learn about AutoLayout and how to use in to create adaptable interfaces in iOS
* Use UIStackViews to create complex user interfaces without the need for a large number of AutoLayout constraints
* Leverage the Model View Controller (MVC) design principles using UIViewController, UINavigationController, and UIView
* Create Outlet and Action connections between the views and view controllers. 
Benefit from the power of Delegates by using them in code
* Navigate between two scenes in the app using UINavigationController
* Play audio files using AVFoundation’s AVAudioEngine class
* Run the iOS simulator and download the app on a physical device 
* Search documentation, resolve bugs, and read other people’s code
​
##Why is this project meaningful to my career?
MVC is the cornerstone of all iOS app development; understanding these principles early set you on the path for success.
Learning how to find answers to development questions by searching documentation emulates the practice of expert software engineers.
​
You will also make a relevant project that you will feel proud to share with your friends, family, and peers.
