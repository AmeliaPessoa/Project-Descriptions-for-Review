**Project Description**
This series of coding challenges is designed to prepare you for the most common causes of friction between Objective-C and Swift. 

**Why this project?** 
When you build an app that employs both of the languages of iOS you want to know that when a variable is passed from Objective-C to Swift, Swift knows what to do with it. With this practice set you can develop good habits for dealing with variables exported by Objective-C in forms that are difficult for Swift to handle, namely, nil values and unspecified types. 

**What will I learn?**

	•	Common problems in interoperability between Objective-C and Swift
	•	Nullability annotations, error handling, careful use of the AnyObject class
	•	How to make your Swift API visible to Objective-C 

**Why is this project meaningful to my career?**
An iOS developer who is able to use APIs written in both Objective-C and Swift is a real asset to any iOS engineering team. Handling interoperability between Swift  and Objective-C is a relatively new challenge and not a trivial one. Mastering this skill will set you apart from other job candidates.
