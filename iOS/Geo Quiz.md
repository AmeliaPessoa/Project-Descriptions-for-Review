You just started your path on iOS development, and dove right in into seeing some of the really powerful stuff iOS can do with just a little bit of code. What you need to do for this project is simply implement the control flow (IF/ELSE statements) to tell the user if they guessed correctly or incorrectly.

Donâ€™t worry about understanding all of the code in the project yet, it contains things that we will cover in the next lessons. The goal of this project is just to get your hands-wet so to speak, playing around with Xcode and seeing what iOS can do. One hour into your iOS Nanodegree and you already have an app to show for it!

One of the great value adds of Udacity is our code review, which is done by real human iOS developers. Submitting this project allows you to see that in action right away.

Many of these developers have had the same questions and concerns as you, and they want to hear what you have to say!
