##Project Overview
Students will create an app that enables a user to take a picture, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme. The user will be able to share the photo on Facebook and Twitter and also by SMS or email. Memes will appear in a tab view with two tabs: a table view and a collection view.
##Why this project?
MemeMe covers many of the major UI components found in essentially every app. It combines them with the camera and social media activity view to create a fun and personal user experience. 
##What Will I learn?
* Access the Camera and Photo Album using the UIImagePickerController
* Understand how Swift optionals, closures, collections, classes, structs and protocols are used in iOS apps
* Create Actions and Outlets with extremely high proficiency
* Use a UIActivityViewController to share media with Facebook, Twitter, SMS, and Email
*  Describe the delegate pattern and give a full account of its importance and uses in iOS classes
* Set up a navigation structure that creates an intuitive flow through the app
* Build tables with datasources and delegates
* Create custom table view cells
* Implement user interfaces with tab views and collection views
