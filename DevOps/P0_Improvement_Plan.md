Project description
Your goal is to create a document that reflects your current knowledge of the situation in your company/team and set some goals you would like to achieve. You will track this knowledge, status and goals as you progress through the ND and update the document accordingly. This will not only serve to show what you have learned, but also as a source for inspiration for changes that you can bring to your organization.
It's OK if you don't know answers to some of these questions right away. You will revisit it and fill details later. Add date to the answer so that you can see how your answers change over time.

# Organizational topics

## What are the goals of your team? What are the goals of your company or organizational unit? Do you think everyone is aligned on the same goals?

Note: Depending on how big your company is you might want to think about several levels of goals, for example 
developing the software that allows selling shoes on internet
selling shoes on internet
selling shoes

## Who are your customers? Are they internal or external? What do they need?
For example - external customers - people who need shoes. Internal customers - warehouse workers who need to know and update the status of inventory.

## What is the current flow of software development and delivery in your team? List the main steps and whether they are manual or automated.

## What are all the teams or people that are involved in a product release, from start to beginning? For example - the product team, developers, testers, sysadmins, marketing

## How does communication look like in your organization? Whom do you work with? Do you only interact with your team members and manager? Do you have cross-team communication? For example - are both developers and operations involved when starting a new project? Do developers get feedback from operations on how their software is performing and act on it?

# Quantitative

## How satisfied are you with how other teams work and support the work that you do (either for each team separately, or together)? (Rate on a scale from 1-10)

## Do deployments go smoothly? How much pain is it? (Rate on a scale from 1-10)

## Do you have planned downtime? What day/time of day are they usually planned and performed? (How often, what times, what would you like it to be)

## How much time it takes to set up environment for a new project? What would be your target experience? (in time units, eg hours or days)

## How often do you deploy to production? What do you think would be optimal? (in deployments per time unit)

## How easy it is to deploy new feature or bugfix from code checkin to repository to live to customers?  (Rate on a scale of 1-10)

## How long time it takes to deploy a new feature or bugfix from code checkin to repository to live to customers? (In time units)

## Do you think the quality of your software is good? How do you measure it? How easy it is to test it?

## How satisfied are your customers? Do you measure it in some way? How would you measure it?

Now that you know the questions, go ahead and look at the rubric that explains what an acceptable deliverable looks like. After that we will have a test subject answer these questions about their company!




Example

# Organizational topics

## What are the goals of your team? What are the goals of your company or organizational unit? Do you think everyone is aligned on the same goals?

### April 13

Goals are - provide an online store for customers -> sell customers goods

## Who is your customer? Is it internal or external? What do they need?

### April 13

We have both internal and external customers. Internal - marketing and customer service teams. External - customers who use the online store.

## What is the current flow of software development and delivery in your team? List the main steps and whether they are manual or automated.

### April 13

Software gets checked into codebase (manual).
Once a week it gets deployed to a test server (manual) where QA team tests it (manual). 
We do major releases usually once a month (I don't know if it's automated or manual, but judging from ops usually staying late for the release days it's manual).

## What are all the teams or people that are involved in a product release, from start to beginning? For example - the product team, developers, testers, sysadmins, marketing

### April 13

Project manager, marketing, design,  developers, testers, ops

## How does communication look like in your organization? Whom do you work with? Do you only interact with your team members and manager? Do you have cross-team communication? For example - are both developers and operations involved when starting a new project? Do developers get feedback from operations on how their software is performing and act on it?

### April 13

We pretty much just talk within a team and with a manager and PM. I sometime talk with other teams over lunch and usually find out a lot of interesting things that sometimes are even helpful at work.

# Quantitative

## How satisfied are you with how other teams work and support the work that you do (either for each team separately, or together)? (Rate on a scale from 1-10)

### April 13

Now - 6. 

## Do deployments go smoothly? How much pain is it and what would you like it to be like? (Rate on a scale from 1-10)

### April 13

Now - 3 (we had major problems the last couple of times)

## Do you have planned downtime? What day/time of day are they usually planned and performed? (How often, what times, what would you like it to be)

### April 13

Yes, usually once every 1-2 months in the night.

## How much time it takes to set up environment for a new project? What would be your target experience? (in time units, eg hours or days)

### April 13

About 2 days, if sysadmins are not busy with release ir a week if they are busy.

## How often do you deploy to production? What do you think would be optimal? (in deployments per time unit)

### April 13

Now - 1/month
Future - maybe 2-3/week

## How easy it is to deploy new feature or bugfix from code checkin to repository to live to customers?  (Rate on a scale of 1-10)

### April 13

Now - 3

## How long time it takes to deploy a new feature or bugfix from code checkin to repository to live to customers? (In time units)

### April 13

1-3 weeks

## Do you think the quality of your software is good? How do you measure it? How easy it is to test it?

### April 13

It's ok. We have a testing team with a good routine and a bugtracker with good rules for dealing with issues.

## How satisfied are your customers? Do you measure it in some way? How would you measure it?

### April 13

They are ok. We have a feedback link on our site, and we follow what people say about us in social media.

Now that you know the questions, go ahead and look at the rubric that explains what an acceptable deliverable looks like. After that we will have a test subject answer these questions about their company!
