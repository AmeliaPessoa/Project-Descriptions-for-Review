# Organizational topics

## What are the goals of your team? What are the goals of your company or organizational unit? Do you think everyone is aligned on the same goals?

### April 13

Goals are - provide an online store for customers -> sell customers goods

## Who is your customer? Is it internal or external? What do they need?

### April 13

We have both internal and external customers. Internal - marketing and customer service teams. External - customers who use the online store.

## What is the current flow of software development and delivery in your team? List the main steps and whether they are manual or automated.

### April 13

Software gets checked into codebase (manual).
Once a week it gets deployed to a test server (manual) where QA team tests it (manual). 
We do major releases usually once a month (I don't know if it's automated or manual, but judging from ops usually staying late for the release days it's manual).

## What are all the teams or people that are involved in a product release, from start to beginning? For example - the product team, developers, testers, sysadmins, marketing

### April 13

Project manager, marketing, design,  developers, testers, ops

## How does communication look like in your organization? Whom do you work with? Do you only interact with your team members and manager? Do you have cross-team communication? For example - are both developers and operations involved when starting a new project? Do developers get feedback from operations on how their software is performing and act on it?

### April 13

We pretty much just talk within a team and with a manager and PM. I sometime talk with other teams over lunch and usually find out a lot of interesting things that sometimes are even helpful at work.

## Do you think the quality of your software is good? How do you measure it? How easy it is to test it?

### April 13

It's ok. We have a testing team with a good routine and a bugtracker with good rules for dealing with issues.

They are ok. We have a feedback link on our site, and we follow what people say about us in social media.

Now that you know the questions, go ahead and look at the rubric that explains what an acceptable deliverable looks like. After that we will have a test subject answer these questions about their company!
