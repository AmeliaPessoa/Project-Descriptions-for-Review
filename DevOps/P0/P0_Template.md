## Organization Snapshot

#### Provide a brief description of your company and your team's role in it.

Replace this entire text with your answer. Please address such questions as:

* What is the company's main business?
* How long has it been in existence?
* How many employees are in the company?
* What is the role of your team or organizational unit within the company? 
* How many employees are in your organizational unit or team?

The response should give a clear picture of the company as a whole and the team's role. 

#### What is the core function of your team? What is the core function of your company or organizational unit? Is the core function of your team well aligned with the function of the larger organizational unit or the company as a whole?

Replace this entire text with your answer. The *core function* of a team is the one clearly stated objective around which the team is organized. A team may have several different responsibilities. For example, an IT team might both provide end-user support and maintain infrastructure such as file servers. But the core function of the team might be something like "ensuring all employees have the IT tools and resources they need to do their jobs efficiently". 

Depending on how big your company is you might want to think about several levels of core business. For example, if you work at a company that sells shoes, these might be the core functions at various levels: 

* Team: developing the software to sell shoes online
* Organizational unit: handling all matters related to selling shoes online
* Company-wide: selling shoes

#### Who are your team's customers? Are they internal or external? What do they need?

Replace this entire text with your answer. To continue with the shoe selling example, the software development team has both external and internal customers. 

* External: the customer purchasing the shoes
* Internal: the warehouse staff who need to fulfill the orders and maintain inventory.

There might be other internal customers as well, such as the accounting department. Any stakeholder who needs some functionality from the software product counts as a customer. 

#### What is the current flow of software development and delivery in your team? List the main steps and whether they are manual or automated. 

Replace this entire text with your answer. Steps might include:

* Specifying desired functionality
* Assessing user requirements
* Coding the application

and so on. 

#### What are all the teams or people that are involved in a product release, from start to finish? 

Replace this entire text with your answer. You will likely include the product team, developers, testers, sysadmins, marketing, and others in this list. 

#### How is communication handled in your organization? 

Replace this entire text with your answer. Consider such questions as:

* Whom do you work with? For work purposes, do you only interact with your team members and manager, or also with people outside your team? Are those external interactions formal meetings, informal chats, or both? 
* Are both developers and operations involved when starting a new project? Do developers receive and act upon feedback from operations regarding how the software is performing?
* How do internal customers make their requirements known? Do they directly communicate with the developers?


## Quantitative Ratings

If a given rating is lower than you would like, we recommend that you provide a short explanation of the issue and some suggestions about how to resolve it. 

#### How satisfied are you with how other teams work and support the work that you do? (Scale: 1-10, 10 is best)

Rating: Replace this text (after "Rating:") with your answer. You may give an overall rating, or separate ratings for each other team. 

#### Do deployments go smoothly? (Scale: 1-10, 10 is best)

Rating: Replace this text (after "Rating:") with your answer. 

#### Do you have planned downtime for system upgrades or maintenance? 

Replace this entire text with your answer. If yes, please specify:

* How long is the maintenance window?
* Is this downtime enough to complete the required upgrades satisfactorily?

#### How much time does it take to set up the environment for a new project?
