# [DevOps P0] Investigate a Product Workflow: Project Description

## Introduction
In this project, you will create a document that describes the current situation in a company as seen from the perspective of an aspiring DevOps engineer. The document should capture the typical processes by which software is built, tested, and put into production. The document should reflect both what processes are going well and what processes could be improved.

The goal of this project is to reinforce the core value of DevOps. DevOps is not just a set of technical tools; it is a way of rethinking business processes throughout the organization. The DevOps philosophy sees IT and software development as core components of the organization, working in collaboration with Marketing, Sales, Accounting, and other teams to advance the core function of the company. To understand the value of DevOps and the mindset of a DevOps engineer, it's necessary to look at the larger business context. This project is meant to help you place the DevOps tools you will learn throughout this Nanodegree program in that larger context.

From the perspective of a DevOps engineer seeking to establish good processes, a startup, a small but established company, and a large corporation pose different challenges of their own. For this project, we have provided one fictional example of each of these three types of companies. You are encouraged to choose whichever of these three examples is closest to your real-life experience (from your current position or from previous jobs), or whichever you find most interesting. 

If you have not worked in a dev or ops position before, you might find these resources helpful in approaching the project: 

* Talk with friends who currently work in IT Ops or software development, asking about the software development and deployment process. What works well? What is difficult? 
* Search the web to get a sense of typical [processes](https://www.google.com/#hl=en&q=IT%20development%20typical%20processes) and [problems](https://www.google.com/#hl=en&q=IT+development+typical+processes+problems) around the software development lifecycle, and use them in your narrative.
* Take a look at the [sample project submission](P0_Sample_Submission.md) that has been provided as a guide. The sample submission uses a different fictional company from the ones provided for your use. 

You will be asked to return to this example for later projects, so please consider your choice carefully. As you progress through the Nanodegree program, you will continuously revisit your project submission to reflect your new skills. This will serve not only to show what you have learned, but also as a source for inspiration for changes that you can bring to your organization using DevOps tools, techniques, and practices.

The project is intended to take about an hour to 1.5 hours to complete. 

## The Questions

You will be asked to answer questions that will provide an overview of the current state of your chosen fictional organization as you understand it today. The questions are meant to be a low-stakes way to get you started thinking like a DevOps engineer. Don't worry about finding the perfect answers! Rather, use the questions as a way of orienting yourself to the sort of issues DevOps engineers tackle. 

#### What is the core function of your team? What is the core function of your company or organizational unit? 

The *core function* of a team is the one clearly stated objective around which the team is organized. A team may have several different responsibilities. For example, an IT team might both provide end-user support and maintain infrastructure such as file servers. But the core function of the team might be something like "ensuring all employees have the IT tools and resources they need to do their jobs efficiently". 

To take another example, if you work at a company that sells shoes, these might be the core functions at various levels: 

* Team: developing the software to sell shoes online
* Organizational unit: handling all matters related to selling shoes online
* Company-wide: selling shoes

#### Who are your team's customers? Are they internal or external? What do they need?

Continuing with the shoe selling example, the software development team has both external and internal customers. 

* External: the customer purchasing the shoes
* Internal: the warehouse staff who need to fulfill the orders and maintain inventory.

There might be other internal customers as well, such as the accounting department. Any stakeholder who needs some functionality from the software product counts as a customer. 

#### What is the current flow of software development and delivery in your team? List the main steps and whether they are manual or automated. 

Steps might include:

* Specifying desired functionality
* Assessing user requirements
* Coding the application

and so on. 

#### How would you characterize communication within the organization? Do team members communicate well with each other? Is communication across teams smooth? How would you improve communication? 

Consider such questions as:

* Does the company or team face any problems that would be avoided with better communication?
* Are both developers and operations involved when starting a new project? Do developers receive and act upon feedback from operations regarding how the software is performing?
* How do internal customers make their requirements known? Do they directly communicate with the developers?

## Submission format

Your document must be submitted in **Markdown format**. Markdown uses a plaintext file and the `.md` file extension to generate a document that renders attractively in a web browser. This document is itself written in Markdown. If you don't know Markdown, rest assured that it's quite easy. A [handy online tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/) promises to teach you all you need to know about Markdown in ten minutes. 

You can download a [template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/udacity/Project-Descriptions-for-Review/master/DevOps/P0/P0_Template.md) that you can use to create your Improvement Plan. The template is already in Markdown and has space for you to provide your answers. Download the template, then edit it to include your answers. Many text editors allow you to edit, save, and preview Markdown documents. For example:

* [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/), a Mac-only application, does so natively
* [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/), for both Mac and Windows, has [extensions](https://www.macstories.net/roundups/sublime-text-2-and-markdown-tips-tricks-and-links/) that provide the preview functionality. 

You can find other Markdown editors on the web. Or you could use any text editor to edit the Markdown template, and any modern web browser to open the document for a preview.
