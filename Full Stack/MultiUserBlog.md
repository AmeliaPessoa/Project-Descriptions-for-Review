Students will build a blog where multiple users can sign in and make posts. 
## How will students complete this project? 
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) 
2. Work through the lessons in the course.
3. At the end of the <TODO attach course link>course you will have a published blog without certain functionalities which are the 'Like', 'Edit' and 'Comment' functionality.
   Users once signed in, should be able to edit their blog post as well as like and comment on other posts. Signed in users should also be able to edit their comments. 
   Users should not be able to like their own post and can only like other posts once.
5. Ensure your website renders correctly when you attempt to load it in a browser.
