# Project Overview
This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making an app that allows a user to keep track of points within a basketball game. 

The goal is to create an Basketball Scores app which gives a user the ability to keep track of the score of two different teams playing basketball.  For this project, we will be helping you plan the steps to build the app, but for future projects you will be doing this planning on your own. 

If you are subscribed to the paid Nanodegree program, coaches will be available in the Coaches Lounge to help guide you through the final project. You will receive feedback after submitting your project and a verified certificate after successfully finishing this project.

If you are enrolled in the free version of this course, the project rubric and all of the project details are available to you.

Either way, we would love to see a description and link to your app on the discussion forum.
# Why this project?
In the most recent portion of the Nanodegree program, you learned how to make use of Java in your Android apps to make them interactive. With Court Counter, you will be practicing this skill set, with particular focus on button code, variable scope, and updating views. 


# What Will I Learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:
* Adding button code to your app
* Updating views
* Properly scoping variables
* Finding views by their ID
