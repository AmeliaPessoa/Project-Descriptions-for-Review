##Project Overview
For this project, students will answer 5 technical interview questions and get feedback from a qualified reviewer.

##Why This Project?
Having the knowledge to get through technical interviews is certainly helpful, but it won’t mean very much if you can’t clearly demonstrate this knowledge. This project will be assessed for correctness, but also criteria a real interviewer would look for, like clear and clean code, an understanding of efficiency, good communication, et cetera.

##What Will I Learn?
You will learn where your interviewing weaknesses lie. Graders have been instructed to be tough, so you cannot pass unless your answers are good enough that a real interviewer would be impressed.

##How Do I Complete this Project?
1. Make sure you have some prior knowledge of technical interviewing or have gone through the Technical Interviewing course.
2. For each question, create a solution in Java (Java 8). All solutions should be functions named as “question1”, “question2”, et cetera. Code solutions must be in a .java file.
3. Write up an explanation for each question in a single separate text (.txt) or markdown (.md) file. Your paragraph should not be a detailed walkthrough of the code you provided, but provide your reasoning behind decisions made in the code. For example, why did you use that data structure? You also need to explain the efficiency (time and space) of your solution.
4. Compress your one Java and one text file into a .zip, and submit on the website.

##Evaluation
Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity Code Reviewer according to the rubric here. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.
