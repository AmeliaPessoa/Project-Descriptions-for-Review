# Project-Descriptions-for-Review

This repository contains project descriptions for Udacity's Code Review Program. 

Some important aspects all the reviewers should think about -

###When to use "Can’t review" button?
* If the submission is incomplete i.e. missing files. Let the student know which files are missing. Please download the project submission before you decide that it is not reviewable - sometimes, the code review tab will not show files if the extensions aren’t right - however, you can still review the project and send feedback to the student. 
* If the submission has all the files, but doesn’t compile. Please tell the student what the issue is. If you are unable to figure out the issue, please be honest with the student. Request the student to reach out to a coach (and also, let us know at review-support@udacity.com)

###What is the expectation from project review? 
* **You must download the project and run it on your machine.** Sometimes, the code review tab will not show some files. You must ensure that the files aren’t missing by downloading the submission. 
* **We expect that you check in depth each criteria given in the rubric.** Even if the student “does not meet specifications” in the first few criteria, you still must give feedback on ALL of the rubric criteria. 
* In cases when the criteria “does not meet specifications”
  * tell the student “why?” 
  * give helpful links or examples that will help the student in fixing all the issues so that they “meet the specifications” in their next iteration. 
* In cases when the criteria “Meets specification” but there is no possibility of exceeding
  * tell the student what they did particularly well.
* In cases when the criteria “Meets Specifications but does not exceed” 
  * let the student know WHY they do not exceed specifications or how could they improve so that they do exceed specifications.  

**Your job is to ensure that after making the suggested changes, student meets specifications in the next submission and student has learned something important from your review.**

###What should I do if I disagree with previous reviewer's call on a rubric criteria?
Strictly follow the given rubric to the best of your understanding. Acknowledge to the student that "this is different from what the earlier reviewer mentioned and you are reaching out to a Udacity coach to resolve this inconsistency." Please send us an email at review-support@udacity.com as soon as you find any such case - with the link to the review and what parts you disagree with.  

It is important that we all agree on one interpretation of the rubric and we would love to have the dialogue with you and other reviewers to bring this together. 

**Rule of thumb - follow the rubric strictly and let us know if you find any inconsistencies so that we can work with the reviewers to make the feedback consistent.**

###What should I do when I  find a submission where student has not made sufficient progress from his last submission?
Send us an email. Have a look at the previous review the student has received. Do you think the student mis-understood the review they received from the earlier reviewer? Let us know at review-support@udacity.com why you think this student hasn’t made much progress from their last submission. A Udacity coach will look into this and reach out to the student and offer help in making progress. 

###What should I do if a student asks a question in the rating comment they made? 
Please send us an email with the link to the review the student wrote feedback on. Also, write your response to the student. We will forward it to the appropriate student and cc you on the communication.

###What should I do if a student gives a low rating and/or says that my feedback was not satisfactory?
Don’t be discouraged. Send us an email and let us know  if you have any clarification on the student’s note. In many cases, there is a misunderstanding that might have caused this. We will work on this together to find out what happened and take appropriate actions. We will remove the comment from your records if we find that the rating is not reflective of the review you have given. If the student is indeed right - take it as a learning opportunity.

###What should I do if the student is really unhappy that the reviews he/she has been getting are inconsistent? 
Send us an email at review-support@udacity.com and we will look into it. In your email, include any insight on whether the earlier reviews are inconsistent and why they are inconsistent. Let the student know that a Udacity coach will get in touch with them via email and they should wait to hear from us before resubmitting. Do your best in strictly following the rubric. A Udacity coach will reach out to the student. 

### Why did I get waitlisted?
Sometimes, we feel that you need some time to reflect on the project, rubric and the learning goals of the project. We do waitlist you in such cases to give you that time. We believe that you have what it takes to be a great reviewer and would love to give you an opportunity to review again in future. Please take this time to learn more about the project. Get back to us in a couple of months and we will consider giving you the opportunity to review the project again.
