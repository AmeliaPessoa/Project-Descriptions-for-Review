# Project Overview
In this practice session, you will implement five functions that correspond to requests given by a series of aliens.

Each function will test your ability to work with Swift concepts like arrays, strings, and optionals. If you correctly implement the function as specified by the alien, then the robot hero will give a proper response and progress further in the adventure. If your implementation is incorrect, then the robot hero will give an improper response and the adventure will end immediately.

# Completing this Project
You should have completed all the necessary steps for finishing this project in Alien Adventure 1 Prep. Before submitting, ensure your app does the following (note: if the robot hero makes it past the alien, then your function passes all acceptance tests!):

* The implementation of the `reverseLongestName` function is correct and passes all acceptance tests.
* The implementation of the `matchMoonRocks` function is correct and passes all acceptance tests.
* The implementation of the `inscriptionEternalStar` function is correct and passes all acceptance tests.
* The implementation of the `leastValuableItem` function is correct and passes all acceptance tests.
* The implementation of the `shuffleStrings` function is correct and passes all acceptance tests.
