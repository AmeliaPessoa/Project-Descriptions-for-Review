# Project Overview
In this practice session, you’ll make the Ship struct more powerful using computed properties. You’ll also add some flexibility to mine and ship creation using custom initializers. We’ll finish up by adding a special twist to Pirate Fleet, seamonsters! Although they may not look like it on the outside, Seamonsters and Mines actually have quite a few things in common, so we’ll write a new protocol to encapsulate those commonalities.

# Completing this Project
You should have completed all the necessary steps for finishing this project in Pirate Fleet 2 Prep. Before submitting, ensure your app contains the following:

* The `Ship` struct has the computed properties representing occupied cells and whether the ship has been sunk.
* The `Mine` struct and Ship struct both have custom initializers
* The `PenaltyCell` protocol has been written.
* The `Seamonster` and `Mine` structs adopt and implement the `PenaltyCell` protocol
