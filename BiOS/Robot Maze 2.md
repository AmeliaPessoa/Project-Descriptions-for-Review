# Project Overview
In this practice session, you are going to implement the random mouse algorithm so that the robot can solve the maze on its own!

Here is the behavior you will be implementing: The robot starts moving from a random spot in the maze. It continues on the same path until encountering a junction. When a junction is reached, the robot chooses a random direction to proceed. If the robot reaches a dead end, it turns around.

Ultimately, with your newfound knowledge of boolean expressions, if statements, switch statements, and functions, you will program a search pattern that leads the robot to the star.

# Completing this Project
You should have completed all the necessary steps for finishing this project in Robot Maze 2. Before submitting, ensure your app does the following:

* After each move, the robot evaluates its new position and makes a decision about which way to turn.
* The robot does not run into any walls.
* When the robot reaches a three-way junction, it chooses randomly from the two available forward directions, but does not turn around.
* When the robot is on a straight two-way path, it proceeds in the same direction.
* If there is a turn in a two-way path, the robot turns toward the clear path, but does not turn around.
* When the robot reaches a dead end it turns around and proceeds in the opposite direction.
* The robot solves the maze by reaching the star.
* When the robot reaches the star, it stops.
