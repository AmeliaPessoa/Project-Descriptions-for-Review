# Project Overview
In this practice session, you will implement eight methods that correspond to requests given by a series of aliens.

Each method will test your ability to work with Swift concepts like errors and closures. If you correctly implement a method as specified by an alien, then the robot hero will give a proper response and progress further in the adventure. If the implementation is incorrect, then the robot hero will give an improper response and the adventure will end immediately.
