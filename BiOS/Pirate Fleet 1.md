# Project Overview
In this practice session, you will create ships, mines, and a final score calculation for the Pirate Fleet app.

To complete these tasks, you will work with two structs already defined by the app: the `GridLocation` struct and `Ship` struct. Also, you will define your very own Mine struct. These structs are required to add ships and mines to the gameboard.

For the final score, you will need to use a combination of variables, constants, and operators to perform the correct calculation.

# Completing this Project
You should have completed all the necessary steps for finishing this project in [Pirate Fleet 1 Prep](https://learn.udacity.com/#/projects/1/skills/100/concepts/26). Before submitting, ensure your app does the following:

* When the app launches, all 5 required ships are added to your gameboard.
* When the app launches, 2 mines are added to your gameboard.
* The final score is correctly calculated and printed when a game ends.

Also, be sure to convert your object diagram for the Pirate Fleet app to a pdf file, and include the diagram in your project submission. Remember, you can use [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) to create your diagram.

# Submitting Your Project
