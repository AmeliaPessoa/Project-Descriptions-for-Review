# Monetize Your Game

This is the third project in the 2D Mobile Game Developer Nanodegree.  Prepare for this project with the Udacity course Engagement and Monetization | Mobile Games.

## Introduction

This project will help you figure out how your mobile game will make money! With this project, you’ll create an idea for a game and identify how it will generate revenue (your monetization strategy). You’ll dig into the details and rationale behind your chosen monetization strategy. Finally, you’ll prepare your game for distribution to an app store and describe your design decisions. The project  that you submit will include five items:

1. Game and Minimum Viable Product: Describe your game and choose the features to include in a minimum viable product. 
2. Engagement Strategy: What you plan to include in your game to make it engaging and encourage your player base to grow.
3. Monetization Strategy and Details: A brief overview of your monetization strategy and an in-depth look at your rationale for  choosing it. 
4. Metrics: What you plan to measure, your rationale for those metrics, and your definition of success for those metrics. 
5. Prepare for Distribution: Design a game icon, name, and keywords and describe your rationale behind your designs.

The portfolio will be submitted as a PDF document.

## Game and Minimum Viable Product

Describe your idea for a game and decide on the features you need to include to create a minimum viable product. 
Focus on answering the following questions:

1. Briefly describe your idea for a complete game. What is the overall gameplay like?
2. Describe how you would simplify your game to create the minimum viable product. What are the minimum set of features that your game must include for it to be entertaining?
3. Justify your choices for the features you included in your minimum viable product. What makes them necessary as opposed to extraneous?
4. Your game description can include as many features as you can imagine for your game, but your minimum viable product should only include those for the simplest version of your game. For each feature that you include in your minimum viable product, describe why it is necessary for the foundation of your game.

## Engagement Strategy

Adding on to your minimum viable product, describe the engagement strategies you will use to improve your game play and encourage your player base to grow.
Focus on answering the following questions about engagement strategy:

1. What features will you include in your game to make it engaging and to encourage your player base to grow? (game pace, competition, social networks, overall player experience, etc.)
2. Explain your choice of engaging features. How does each feature contribute to player engagement?

There are many ways to make your game engaging and get your players invested in the game, so choose engaging features that fit your game. Keeping players interested in your game with a good engagement strategy is the first step to successfully monetizing your game.

## Monetization Strategy and Details

Begin with a short description of your overall monetization strategy. Then dive into describing the rationale behind the methods you chose.
The most important questions this description should answer are:
1. How do you plan to make money? What is your overall strategy?
2. What are the specific methods you will use to make money? (pricing, mobile ads, in-app purchases, merchandise, etc.)
3. Justify your use of each monetization method your choose. Why will these methods make money for your game?

The strategy should focus on these three core questions to help drive profitability. If you are using more than one method to make money, you should explain the rationale for each of your methods  and how they build upon each other.
Costs of distribution and creating the app should not be mentioned in this write up. Your focus should be limited to outlining the revenue-generating capabilities of the app.

## Metrics: Your Definition of Success

What are the most important things you’ll track to determine if your monetization strategy works and how users are behaving? What do these metrics indicate? 
Below are some examples of metrics and results that could indicate a successful monetization strategy (depending on your game):
1. Higher than X minutes played in an average game session.
2. Players average more than X sessions per day or per week.
3. More than YY% of your users stay one day/week/month after they first start playing.
4. More than YY% of your users are paying customers, meaning they pay for in-app purchases or merchandise, for any given month.
5. Each user brings in $XXX.XX in ad revenue a month.

Your actual metrics will vary depending on your revenue goals, your game, and your monetization strategy, but they should all provide confidence that your game is engaging and will **drive revenue over** time so that it ultimately reaches profitability.

## Prepare for Distribution

Design a game icon, name, and keywords for your game display in an app store. You may choose to submit a 114x114px icon or just describe it.

1. Submit or describe your icon, and your choices for game name and keywords. Please choose at least five different keywords.
2. For these **three** components (icon, name, keywords) answer the questions:
    * What were your design considerations for this component?
    * What characteristics of this component will help make your game noticeable on an app distribution platform?

As you design your game’s appearance on an app distribution platform consider the relevance, searchability, and uniqueness of each design.
